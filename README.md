# Barn

Repo for David & Ellen's Wedding barn.

### Next

1. Trigger video on raycast hit (or enter frame?)
2. Masking video edges / animating mask.
3. (Possibly) linking rotary encoder movement of prefabs (allow for photos to
    move @ different speed)

### Ideas

- Child the video prefabs to a GameObject so you can find the first one and play it...
